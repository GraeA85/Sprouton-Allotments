# Sprouton Allotments

Sproughton Allotments are a community run allotment site for veteran and beginner allotmenteers to create, grow and showcase their garden and allotment sites. The website is targeted at existing Sprouton Allotment owners to keep up to date with allotment developments, as well as budding gardeners hoping to get their hands dirty and jump into an allotment of their own. The website is designed to inform people about the allotment site, what can be done with an allotment and place themselves on a waiting list for an allotment in the future. 

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar is present across all three pages of the Sprouton Allotment webiste. It is fully responsive and includes links to the home page, image gallery and the allotment application page. The navigation bar is in a fixed position therefore always visible to the user when scrolling the page. This is effective UX design, preventing the user to have to scroll back to the top of the page manually, or rely on auto-scoll buttons placed on the website. The navigation bar shrinks to a "hamburger" icon and presents the links in a drop-down menu when the website is viewed on smaller screens such as a mobile phone or smaller tablet.


- __The landing page__

  - The landing is broken up into sections. The first section is "Our Allotment Story" giving the user some background and current information regarding the allotment site. It also includes an embedded google map to show the location of the Allotment Site. I have used font awesome icons relevant to each section (the story book icon to represent the background story of the allotment site).
  The second section introduces the website visitor to the allotment committee - briefly explaining their role, names and contact information. I have included a photograph to allow existing site owners to recognise the committee members whenever they meet in person. This also gives new visitors to the site a prosepective of the owners and the mutual ideals of the allotment site. 
  Each section is succinct as to give the user enough information without information overload.
  The third section of the website is about the allotment site itself. Giving the website user information on the number of allotments available, the sizes available and other important details about the site. This is accompanied by an image of the allotment site layout which gives new users their bearings and existing owners a handy map. 
  The fourth section gives the user information on the benefits of owning an allotment. I have included a video produced by the National Allotment Society, showcasing the benefits. This is included as to persuade new users to sign up for an allotment and remind existing owners just how good they have it!
  
  - The next section is split into three parts - a getting started equipment guide, a growing guide and a stock list of the on-site allotment shop. I have presented the equipment list and allotment shop as modals that open upon clicking the button. The growing guide links to an external pdf provided by a well-established gardening company with permission to use.



- __Image Gallery__

  - The image gallery page includes photographs of the allotment site, produce grown on the allotment and other relevant photos designed to visually explain the allotment site and encourage people to join the waiting list. 
  - The image are presented in a visually appealing grid box which is fully responsive. 
   

- __Waiting list application  page__

  - This page of the site allows the site visitor to apply to join the waiting list for Sproughton allotments. It includes a relevant image (soil in a heart shape being held) with a form to gather the prospective owners information. The form and image are fully responsive. The form makes use of the "required" attribute to ensure all required information is inputted by the user. Once complete the user can click the submit button which will take the user to a "thank you" page. The thank you page is included to provide feedback to the user that their request has been acknowledged. The thank you page opens in a new browser tab to prevent the user losing their place on the main website - it also includes links to return to the homepage or further information on contacting the allotment site owners.
  
- __Website Footer__

 - The footer present on each page of the website includes links to Sprouton Allotments social media pages. Each link will open in a new tab to allow the user to easily switch between the two and not lose their original position on the Sprouton Allotments website.
 - The links are facebook, instagram, twiiter and YouTube.

 __Wireframes__

Using Balsamiq I created a wireframe for the website for both a desktop browser and mobile phone browser.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- A members only area of the website - including seed-swaps, equipment-loan and allotment market information.

## Testing 



### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
